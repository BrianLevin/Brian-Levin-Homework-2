“This is my homework 2. I will make sure to add more separated commits on my next homework. I started off creating an index, contact, and portfolio html page. I then used a navbar for my index page from bootstrap. I then formatted my html text within containers rows and columns. I then found an image online and copy and pasted it into my images 1 folder. I then used styling to  help space out my classes on a separate style.css page. I added a footer at the end of the page to show that this is the bottom of the page. On my contact.html page, I copied and pasted my navbar from my original index.html page. I then created a container class to wrap my rows and columns. Within my rows and columns, I wrapped the H1 title of my document and the Bootstrap form I got from online. I copied and pasted the label within the form twice to match the "name" and "email address" column. I deleted the "example select" and the "example multiple select" box from the form since the select options were not necessary. I kept the “textera” box and renamed it "message". I also copied and pasted a submit button from a different form. I then added a footer ID class to signify the bottom of the page. I also created an contact.css styling page and styled some elements to help space and align them properly. With the portfolio page, I copy and pasted my navbar from my index.html page to the portfolio.html page. I wrapped my elements within containers, rows and columns. I also made a page-header class to demonstrate the title I then took the boot strap cards format and copied and pasted all my images in the cards to show where my projects would be. I listed my projects in chronological order. I also put empty links below my images to  where I will store my future project links. I also added a footer on the bottom of the page to show that this is the bottom and tried making the footer sticky. I then made a separate portfolio.css page and styled out individual elements to space them out. I made sure each page had its own styling and commented out every change and addition I made to this homework."
